# Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning
This repository will contain projects related to Neural Networks, Deep Learning.

Python+Basics+With+Numpy+v3.ipynb    
This contains basic numpy functions and how to use them,  how to reshape numpy arrays . This also has code that shows about vectorization.

Neural_Networks.ipynb  
Simple Neurlal Network with one hidden Layer
To Solve the parity bit problem. The desired output for the parity problem is 1 if an input pattern contains an odd number of 1's and 0 otherwise.

Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v4.ipynb  
Using Logistic regression as a simple neural network and classidying if a given image is of cat or not.

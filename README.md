This repository will contain projects related to Neural Networks, Deep Learning.

1.  
Python+Basics+With+Numpy+v3.ipynb    
This contains basic numpy functions and how to use them,  how to reshape numpy arrays . This also has code that shows about vectorization.

2.  
Neural_Networks.ipynb  
Simple Neurlal Network with one hidden Layer
To Solve the parity bit problem. The desired output for the parity problem is 1 if an input pattern contains an odd number of 1's and 0 otherwise.

3.  
Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v4.ipynb  
Using Logistic regression as a simple neural network and classidying if a given image is of cat or not.

4.  
Planar+data+classification+with+one+hidden+layer+v4.ipynb
Neural Network 2 layers.
Classifying the labels of image into its corresponding labels uing a 2 layer neural network
